# loris-stumper-smasher-emacs


dependencies:

sudo dnf install cmake
sudo dnf install libvterm
- cmake
- libvterm


note:

this config uses vim keybindings, if you don't want them, remove them in the init.el (know that this will destroy other keybindings, you'll have to fix it)
(or not)

also, make sure to delete the ~/.emacs (if you have it), otherwise, the config won't load as .emacs is another config file that has the priority on the init.el I'm giving you :)
